	•	Add a subtle animated white “light sweep” (diagonal or horizontal) only on the “Request early access” button beside “See how it works”.
	•	The sweep should:
	•	Loop every 6–8 seconds
	•	Be soft (low opacity, blurred edges)
	•	Stop on hover
	•	Do not add this effect to any other button on the site.

Also:
	•	The navigation area (“The Problem”, “Who it’s for”) feels empty.
	•	Add a secondary outline-style button in the header (right side), same height as nav items:
	•	Label: “View sample dashboard”
	•	On hover: slight background tint + right arrow slide (2–4px)

⸻

🔹 “Where compliance work quietly breaks”
	•	Keep layout exactly the same.
	•	Add hover elevation to the four problem cards:
	•	On hover:
	•	Card moves up 6–8px
	•	Shadow becomes softer but deeper
	•	Border slightly darkens
	•	Transition should feel heavy and deliberate (≈300ms ease-out)
	•	Icons:
	•	Tint icons subtly using muted dashboard colors (grey-blue, amber, red).
	•	Do NOT make them colorful by default.
	•	On hover, increase saturation slightly.

No scroll animations here. This section should feel stable but uncomfortable.

🔹 “Know exactly who did what — always” (Recent Activity section)

This is the most important interactive section.

Activity card changes:
	•	Match colors with dashboard:
	•	Upload → muted blue
	•	Filed → soft green
	•	Assigned → neutral grey
	•	Replace static left dots with interactive status indicators:
	•	Small filled circle
	•	On hover:
	•	Circle expands into a soft halo
	•	Row background subtly lifts
	•	Add entry animation for activity rows:
	•	Rows fade + slide up one by one
	•	Delay: 80–120ms stagger
	•	Trigger once on scroll into view

Micro-interaction:
	•	Hovering an activity row:
	•	Slight left border appears (2px)
	•	Border color matches activity type
	•	Icon background softly pulses once

Do not animate the left text content.

⸻

🔹 “Firm-wide clarity, tailored by role”

Merge this with “Built for every role in your firm”.

Structure:
	•	Left: role switcher tabs
	•	Partners / Managers / Staff
	•	Right: single dashboard preview card

Interaction:
	•	Switching roles:
	•	Dashboard updates content (not layout)
	•	Use crossfade + slight vertical shift (≤10px)
	•	Each role shows:
	•	One bold stat
	•	One short insight sentence
	•	One highlighted UI element (e.g. overdue filings, workload, assignments)

Keep it calm. This is authority, not excitement.

⸻

🔹 “This is not another Drive folder or Excel tracker”

Keep the section but reframe visually.

Design change:
	•	Split each card into:
	•	❌ What breaks (muted red)
	•	✅ What FirmOps does instead (soft green)

Interaction:
	•	On hover:
	•	Red fades slightly
	•	Green becomes clearer
	•	Card tilts by 1–2 degrees max
	•	Icons:
	•	Animate a quick cross → check morph on hover

This section should feel like clarity cutting through noise.

⸻

🔹 Final CTA: “Ready to structure your firm?”
	•	Improve background gradient:
	•	Dark navy → charcoal
	•	Text:
	•	Make “Ready to structure your firm?” slightly brighter than subtext
	•	Button:
	•	Reuse the white light sweep animation
	•	Slower loop here (≈10 seconds)
	•	Add subtle ambient motion:
	•	Very slow radial glow behind button (barely visible)

This should feel calm, confident, inevitable.

⸻

🔹 Global rules (important)
	•	No confetti.
	•	No bounce animations.
	•	No constant motion.
	•	Motion only on:
	•	Hover
	•	First appearance
	•	Intentful interaction

Everything should feel like a serious operations system, not a SaaS toy.
