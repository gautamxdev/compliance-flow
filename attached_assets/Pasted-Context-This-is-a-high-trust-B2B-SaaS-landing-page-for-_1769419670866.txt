Context:
This is a high-trust B2B SaaS landing page for Indian CA firms.
Tone: calm, confident, modern, system-oriented.
Avoid playful or gimmicky animations.
Motion should suggest a live operating system.

⸻

1. REMOVE SECTION
	•	Completely remove the “How it works” section and all related navigation references.
	•	Do not replace it with another step-by-step explanation.

⸻

2. WHERE COMPLIANCE WORK QUIETLY BREAKS (Problem section)

Layout changes
	•	Keep the 2x2 card grid.
	•	Add subtle vertical stagger:
	•	top-left normal
	•	top-right +12px
	•	bottom-left +24px
	•	bottom-right +36px

Animation
	•	On scroll into view:
	•	cards fade in with slight upward motion (8–12px)
	•	stagger by 120ms
	•	Inside each card:
	•	icon softly pulses once (opacity 0.6 → 1 → 0.6) and then stops
	•	Add a very faint animated gradient line along the card border that moves once and freezes (suggesting “stress points”).

No hover effects. This section should feel quietly broken, not loud.

⸻

3. KNOW EXACTLY WHO DID WHAT — ALWAYS (Activity section)

Very important: animate ONLY the activity feed, NOT the text.

Visual updates
	•	Match the activity card colors to the FirmOps dashboard:
	•	subtle tinted backgrounds per activity type
	•	upload → light blue tint
	•	filed → light green
	•	assigned → neutral gray
	•	Replace the static left icons with:
	•	soft animated status dots:
	•	pulse once on load
	•	then remain static

Animation behavior
	•	When section enters viewport:
	•	activity rows appear one-by-one, top to bottom
	•	each row slides in from right (16px) + fade
	•	150ms stagger
	•	Every ~6 seconds:
	•	simulate a new activity appearing at the top
	•	older entries shift down slightly (like a real feed)
	•	Text content never animates.
	•	No looping shimmer. This must feel “live”, not decorative.

4. MERGED SECTION

Firm-wide visibility without micromanagement
	•	Built for every role in your firm

New structure
	•	Title stays: Firm-wide visibility without micromanagement
	•	Subtitle explains roles implicitly, not explicitly.

Replace 3 boring role cards with:
	•	One interactive system panel:
	•	Left: compact filter-style UI (Partners / Managers / Staff)
	•	Right: content changes based on selected role

Interaction
	•	Clicking each role:
	•	smoothly swaps content (no page reload)
	•	subtle crossfade + slide (8px)
	•	Each role shows:
	•	one sharp insight
	•	one concrete outcome
	•	one visual cue (badge, counter, or status)

Example (do NOT show as text-heavy lists):
	•	Partner → “Firm health overview”
	•	Manager → “Workload balance”
	•	Staff → “Clear next task”

This section should feel like using the product, not reading about it.

⸻

5. THIS IS NOT ANOTHER DRIVE FOLDER OR EXCEL TRACKER

Yes, keep it — but elevate it.

Changes
	•	Convert the 4 cards into interactive contrast cards.
	•	On hover (desktop) or tap (mobile):
	•	card flips or slides to reveal:
	•	“What most firms do” vs “What FirmOps does”
	•	Add subtle red → green contrast accents:
	•	red = chaos
	•	green = structure

Animation
	•	On scroll:
	•	cards rise slightly from background (depth effect)
	•	Icons animate once:
	•	X icon draws itself
	•	then stops forever

This section should feel like myths being dismantled, not disclaimers.

⸻

6. FINAL CTA SECTION (REBUILD COMPLETELY)

Replace “Built for firms that take compliance seriously” section

New vibe
	•	Dark background stays
	•	Add a soft animated gradient mesh (very slow, 20–30s loop)

Text
	•	Keep it minimal.
	•	One strong line.
	•	One supporting line.

Primary CTA: “Request a demo”

Button animation (IMPORTANT)
	•	Add a moving light sweep across the button:
	•	diagonal or horizontal
	•	runs every 4–5 seconds
	•	subtle white highlight
	•	On hover:
	•	button slightly lifts (2px)
	•	glow intensifies briefly

This should feel premium, not salesy.

⸻

7. GLOBAL MOTION RULES (STRICT)
	•	No global fade-ins
	•	No bouncing
	•	No continuous looping except:
	•	activity feed simulation
	•	CTA light sweep
	•	background mesh (very slow)

Motion should imply:

“This system is already running — you’re just joining.”
